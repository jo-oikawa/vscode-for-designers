# Welcome to your notepad!

This is a sample note to get you started. You can write anything here — ideas, reminders, meeting notes, whatever you need.

## How notes work

- Each `.md` file in this `notes/` folder becomes a page in your notepad
- Write in plain text or use **Markdown** formatting (bold, lists, headings)
- Create as many note files as you like — they'll all show up in the dashboard

## Tips

- Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize longer notes
- Use `- [ ]` to create quick checklists inside a note
- Ask Copilot to help you format or reorganize your notes anytime
