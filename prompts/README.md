# Prompts

Reusable prompt files (`.prompt.md`) you can use directly in GitHub Copilot Chat.

Prompt files let you save and share useful instructions for Copilot. You can run them from the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code by referencing them with `/` or by opening them directly.

## How to use a prompt file

1. Copy the `.prompt.md` file into your project (or into `.github/prompts/`)
2. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code
3. Type `/` and select the prompt file from the list, or open the file and click **Run Prompt**

## How to create your own

Create a new file ending in `.prompt.md`. Write your instructions in plain Markdown. You can include placeholders like `${input:variableName}` for dynamic values.
