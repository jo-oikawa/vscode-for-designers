# vscode-for-designers

> A resource for designers learning to build with VS Code and GitHub Copilot — no engineering background required.

---

## Overview

VS Code is one of the most powerful creative tools available today — and with GitHub Copilot, you can build real things without being an expert programmer. This repo is a curated collection of tools, examples, prompt files, and guides specifically for **designers** who want to start building.

Whether you're prototyping an idea, automating a repetitive task, or exploring what's possible with AI-assisted coding, this is your starting point.

## Getting Started

1. **Install VS Code** — [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. **Enable GitHub Copilot** — Sign up at [github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and install the extension in VS Code
3. **Read the first guide** — Head to [`guides/getting-started.md`](guides/getting-started.md) for a walkthrough of setting up VS Code for design work
4. **Explore the examples** — Browse [`examples/`](examples/) to see runnable projects you can learn from and remix

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an example, tool, guide, or prompt that would help other designers, feel free to open a pull request.

Please keep contributions:
- **Beginner-friendly** — assume the reader is a designer, not an engineer
- **Focused** — one idea or example per contribution
- **Well-explained** — include a README or inline comments so it's easy to follow
